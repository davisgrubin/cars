This is the repo for the github pages website of my answers to the exercises in <i>Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models</i> Trying to follow the principle that communicating and articulating the material you are learning as if teaching someone else is one of the best ways to learn, while also picking up github pages and Rmarkdown in the process. Website is here: https://davisgrubin.github.io/gelman_multilevel_modeling/.
